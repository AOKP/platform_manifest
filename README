[Android Open Kang Project](aokp.co)
====================================


Download the source
--------------

Please read the [AOSP building instructions](http://source.android.com/source/index.html) before proceeding.

Initialize

    repo init -u https://github.com/AOKP/platform_manifest.git -b jb-mr1

Run the following to sync the source

    repo sync

***

Download the kernel source
--------------------------

Integrated kernel building is now **required** to compile AOKP for _all_ supported devices (even Nexus devices!)

From the root of your source tree, run the following script to grab the kernel sources required

    . ./platform_manifest/manual_add_kernel_manifest.sh

Then run another `repo sync`



***

Building
--------

After the sync is finished, please read the [instructions from the Android site](http://s.android.com/source/building.html) on how to build.

    . build/envsetup.sh
    brunch


You can also build (and see how long it took) for specific devices like this:

    . build/envsetup.sh
    time brunch aokp_mako-userdebug

Remember to `make clobber` every now and then!
